I added this page so I can edit the text in each version for news from github it's pretty cool.

Sadly I may not be able to work on this every day because of school. As you probably know school is higher priority than coding or
computer. As such I may not be able to code on some days. I have also decided to add a webhook to the discord so you can see every
time it updates to read it!

This game will be in heavy development from now on to try to improve the graphics as well as other aspects of the game.

I will not be releasing updates anymore for a while because I am going to be rebuilding the engine so I can make the game better than before.
