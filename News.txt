I added this page so I can edit the text in each version for news from github it's pretty cool.

Sadly I may not be able to work on this every day because of school. As you probably know school is higher priority than coding or
computer. As such I may not be able to code on some days. I have also decided to add a webhook to the discord so you can see every
time it updates to read it!

This game will be in heavy development from now on to try to improve the graphics as well as other aspects of the game.

I will not be releasing updates anymore for a while because I am going to be rebuilding the engine so I can make the game better 
than before.

UPDATE TIME!!
I have decided that the basic java engine is ok for what it is. It simply started as a test to practice problem solving and coding.
I have been working very hard on adding multiplayer support into the game! I wish to change the saving format soon because the png
files are too large and will not work for what I desire. I will potentially be moving to a txt kind of file to save the workd as
because it's more stable to use ids instead of using colors. That does mean however, that I can no longer change ids without world
corruption. Just giving you a heads up to what's going on!

The game will now be fixed and will be slowly worked on over the next few weeks. I hope to get some major updates out before christmas
so you guys can check it all out. I want this game to go somewhere, but I don't yet know the direction to go into. What should this
game become? Tell me in the discord!
